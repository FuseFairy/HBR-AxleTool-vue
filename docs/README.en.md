# HBR-AxleTool-vue - Heaven Burns Red Action-Axis Editor

This is a web tool designed for the mobile game "[Heaven Burns Red](https://heaven-burns-red.com/)" to help players easily share their action-axis in battles.

Through a visual interface, players can record the skill casting order of characters in each turn and export the final action-axis as an image or share it with friends via a URL.

## üí° Future Development Plans

We are planning to develop a desktop assistant tool to complement this website, which will have the following core features:

-   **Real-time Battle Recording**: Using computer vision technology, the tool will be able to recognize characters, skills used, and turn numbers in real-time as the player plays the game.
-   **Action-Axis Generation**: It will be able to upload data to this website to generate an axis, which can then be further edited and shared.

The goal of this feature is to fully automate the manual recording process, allowing players to focus more on the battle itself. Stay tuned!

## ü§ù Contribution and Assistance

This project currently welcomes contributions from the community, especially for translating and proofreading in-game data.

### **Seeking: Simplified Chinese (Bilibili Server) Translation Partner**

As the developer primarily uses Traditional Chinese, some game terminology and skill names for the Bilibili server may not be accurate or up-to-date. If you are familiar with the terminology of the HBR Bilibili server and are willing to help maintain the Simplified Chinese translation data, please contact me through the following methods.

### **Welcome Contributors for Other Languages**

In addition to Simplified Chinese for the Bilibili server, we sincerely welcome any contributors who can provide translations for **other languages** (such as English, Korean, etc.). If you would like to help this tool support more languages and assist more players from different regions, please do not hesitate to contact us!
