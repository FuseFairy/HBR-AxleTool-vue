# HBR-AxleTool-vue - Heaven Burns Red Action Timeline Editor

This is a web-based tool designed for the mobile game "[Heaven Burns Red](https://heaven-burns-red.com/)" to help players easily share their action timelines from battles.

Through a visual interface, players can record the skill execution order for each character per turn and export the final timeline as an image or share it with friends via a URL.

## üí° Future Development Plans

We are planning to develop a desktop assistant tool to complement this website, which will have the following core features:

-   **Real-time Battle Recording**: Using computer vision, the tool will recognize characters, skills used, and turn counts in real-time as you play.
-   **Timeline Generation**: It will be able to upload this data to our website to generate a timeline, which can then be edited and shared.

The goal of this feature is to fully automate the manual recording process, allowing players to focus more on the battle itself. Stay tuned!

## ü§ù Contribution and Support

This project currently welcomes community contributions, especially for translating and proofreading in-game data.

### **Seeking: Simplified Chinese (Bilibili Server) Translation Partner**

As the developer primarily uses Traditional Chinese, some game terminology and skill names for the Bilibili server may not be accurate or up-to-date. If you are familiar with the terminology of the "Heaven Burns Red" Bilibili server and are willing to help maintain the Simplified Chinese translation data, please contact me through the following methods.

### **Welcome Contributors for Other Languages**

In addition to Simplified Chinese for the Bilibili server, we sincerely welcome contributors who can provide translations in **other languages** (such as English, Korean, etc.). If you would like to help this tool support more languages and assist more players from different regions, please do not hesitate to contact us!
